# Cats-vs-Dogs-Classification
This is an image classification problem where the goal is to train a Machine Learning model to distinguish between images of cats and dogs.
I created a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow and Keras to classify images of cats and dogs, following a video as guide.
